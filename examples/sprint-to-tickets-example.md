# Sprint Planning to Autonomous Tickets
## Example: CarGO Project Sprint Conversion

**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose**: Show how business requirements from sprint planning convert into autonomous development tickets with executable acceptance criteria.

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Original Sprint Planning Session**

### **Business Requirements from Parth (Client)**
*"I need a voice interview platform that can score candidates in real-time and send results to our hiring dashboard. The scoring should be transparent so we can justify decisions to candidates."*

### **Strategic Objectives**
1. **Voice Interview Recording**: Capture and store interview audio
2. **Real-time Scoring**: AI analysis of candidate responses
3. **Transparent Feedback**: Explainable scoring criteria
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Results feed into hiring workflow
5. **Candidate Communication**: Automated feedback delivery

acceptance_criteria:
  - User can start voice recording through web interface
  - Audio streams are captured and stored securely
  - Recording status is visible to interviewer in real-time
  - Audio files are accessible for downstream processing

red_test_requirements:
  - POST /interviews/{id}/recording/start returns 200

  - Privacy: Audio encrypted at rest and in transit
```

### **Ticket 2: AI Scoring Engine Integration**
```yaml
title: "Real-time Candidate Scoring with Explainable Results"
business_requirement: "AI must score candidates during interview and provide transparent reasoning"
acceptance_criteria:
  - Audio analysis produces numerical scores (0-100)
  - Scoring includes specific criteria (communication, technical knowledge, etc.)
  - Results available within 30 seconds of interview completion
  - Scoring rationale is human-readable and actionable

red_test_requirements:
  - POST /interviews/{id}/analyze returns structured scoring data
  - Score breakdown includes category-specific metrics
  - Response time < 30 seconds for 5-minute interview
  - Explanation text is non-technical and candidate-appropriate

technical_constraints:
  - Integration: AI service API with retry logic
  - Performance: Streaming analysis for real-time feedback
  - Reliability: Fallback to manual scoring if AI unavailable
  - Audit: Complete scoring decision trail for compliance
```

### **Ticket 3: Hiring Dashboard Integration**
```yaml
title: "Interview Results Feed to Hiring Dashboard"
business_requirement: "Hiring team must see interview results immediately in their existing workflow"
acceptance_criteria:
  - Interview scores appear in hiring dashboard automatically
  - Dashboard shows candidate details, scores, and next steps
  - Hiring team can approve/reject with one click
  - Decision triggers automated candidate communication

red_test_requirements:
  - PUT /hiring/candidates/{id}/interview-results updates dashboard
  - Dashboard API returns candidate with interview data
  - Approval decision persists in database with audit trail
  - Notification system triggers on decision events

technical_constraints:
  - Integration: Existing hiring system API compatibility
  - Real-time: Dashboard updates within 5 seconds
  - Permissions: Role-based access for hiring team members
  - Reliability: Queue-based processing with retry logic
```

## ðŸ”„ **Autonomous TDD Execution Example**

### **RED Phase Implementation**
```typescript
// Agent writes failing test based on ticket requirements
describe('Voice Interview Recording', () => {
  it('should start recording and return trace ID', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/interviews/test-id/recording/start')
      .expect(200);

    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('status', 'recording');
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('traceId');
    expect(response.body.traceId).toMatch(/^[a-f0-9-]{36}$/);
  });

  it('should create audio file in secure storage', async () => {
    // This test will fail initially - that's the RED state
    const audioFile = await storage.get('interviews/test-id/audio.webm');
    expect(audioFile).toBeDefined();
    expect(audioFile.encryption).toBe('AES-256');
  });
});
```

### **GREEN Phase Implementation**
```typescript
// Agent writes minimal code to make tests pass
export async function startRecording(interviewId: string) {
  const traceId = generateTraceId();

  // Minimal implementation to satisfy test
  const audioStream = createAudioStream();
  const secureFile = await storage.store(
    `interviews/${interviewId}/audio.webm`,
    audioStream,
    { encryption: 'AES-256' }
  );

  return {
    status: 'recording',
    traceId,
    audioFile: secureFile.id
  };
}
```

### **REFACTOR Phase Implementation**
```typescript
// Agent improves code quality while maintaining GREEN state
export async function startRecording(interviewId: string): Promise<RecordingResponse> {
  const traceId = generateTraceId();

  try {
    const audioStream = createSecureAudioStream(interviewId);
    const audioFile = await secureStorage.storeWithEncryption(
      buildAudioPath(interviewId),
      audioStream
    );

    await auditLog.record('interview_recording_started', {
      interviewId,
      traceId,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });

    return {
      status: 'recording' as const,
      traceId,
      audioFile: audioFile.id
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new BusinessError('Recording initialization failed', { traceId, error });
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“Š **Log Monitoring During Autonomous Development**

### **Test Output Monitoring**
```bash
# What agent sees in logs/test-output.log
âœ“ Voice Interview Recording
  âœ“ should start recording and return trace ID (25ms)
  âœ“ should create audio file in secure storage (150ms)
  âœ“ should handle recording errors gracefully (45ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Time:        0.8s
```

### **Development Server Feedback**
```bash
# What agent sees in logs/dev-server.log
[2025-09-19 14:23:15] Compilation successful
[2025-09-19 14:23:16] Server listening on port 3001
