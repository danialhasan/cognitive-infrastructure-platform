# Claude Code Anonymous - Live Demo Script
## Attention Decoupling Breakthrough Showcase

**🎯 Demo Goal**: Prove that systematic cognitive infrastructure eliminates the human attention bottleneck in AI-assisted development.

**⏱️ Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**👥 Audience**: 65 builders using agentic coding tools
**🎪 Format**: Live demonstration with real tools and workflows

---

## 🎤 **Opening Hook** (2 minutes)

### **The Problem Setup**
*"How many of you have experienced this: You set your AI agent to work on something, then you have to wait around to unblock them when they get stuck? You start doing other work, lose track of time, come back 20 minutes later and your agent has been idle, waiting for you?"*

**[Show of hands - this will be everyone]**

*"That's the fundamental problem with AI-assisted development today. Your agent productivity is coupled to your attention. You can't walk away because they'll just... stop."*

### **The Breakthrough Statement**
*"I'm about to show you how we completely decoupled human attention from agent productivity. This isn't theory - this is the actual workflow I used yesterday to build an entire client project while I went to the gym."*

## 🔄 **Demo Part 1: Claude Code + RUBE** (4 minutes)

### **Setup Context**
*"First, let me show you something most people don't know exists. Claude Code doesn't just write code - it can connect to 500+ apps through something called RUBE MCP."*

### **Live Demo Commands**
```bash
# Show RUBE connectivity
claude mcp list
# "Look - RUBE is connected to my Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Slack, Linear..."

# Demonstrate cognitive automation
claude "Take my recent client emails and generate a project status report"
# Shows real email synthesis → structured business intelligence

# Show cross-platform intelligence
claude "Find all mentions of our CarGO project across Slack, email, and Linear, then create an executive summary"
# Shows data correlation across tools
```

### **Audience Insight**
*"This is cognitive automation. Not just writing code, but systematic business intelligence. Your AI becomes your Chief of Staff, not just your coding assistant."*

## 🧪 **Demo Part 2: Codex + TDD Attention Decoupling** (6 minutes)

### **The Core Methodology**
*"Now the breakthrough. Watch this carefully - I'm going to set up a development cycle, walk away, and let the agent work autonomously."*

### **Live Setup** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Show the infrastructure
echo "Setting up autonomous development environment..."

# Display the methodology
cat methodologies/attention-decoupling.md | head -20

# Show log piping setup
npm run test:watch > logs/test-output.log 2>&1 &
npm run dev > logs/dev-server.log 2>&1 &
tail -f logs/*.log | head -10
```

### **Business Requirement Loading** (1 minute)
```bash
# Show ticket with business requirements
cat tickets/example-feature.json
# "Here's a real business requirement: User approval must persist in database with trace ID"

# Show the RED test that will be written
echo "Agent will write a failing test that captures these exact requirements..."
```

### **The Attention Decoupling Moment** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Start autonomous cycle
codex autonomous-development \
  --ticket "user-approval-persistence" \
  --duration "demo-mode-5min" \
  --business-requirements "logs/requirements.txt"

# The critical moment
echo "Setting timer for 12 hours..."
# Show timer on screen

echo "I'm walking away. Agent has business requirements, can read logs, will TDD autonomously."
# Literally step away from computer

# Show autonomous progress
tail -f logs/autonomous-progress.log
# "Look - it's writing RED tests... now making them GREEN... now refactoring..."
```

### **Results Showcase** (1 minute)
```bash
# Show completed work
git log --oneline --since="5 minutes ago"
cat logs/test-results.log | grep "PASS"

echo "Feature completed. Business requirements satisfied. No human attention required."
```

## 💡 **The Paradigm Shift Explanation** (2 minutes)

### **Before vs After**
*"Let me explain what just happened. Traditional model:"*
```
Agent Productivity = Human Attention × AI Capability
```

*"New model:"*
```
Agent Productivity = Cognitive Architecture × Business Alignment
```

### **Why This Changes Everything**
*"This isn't just faster development. This is a fundamental shift in how knowledge work gets done. You architect cognitive systems that understand business intent and execute autonomously."*

*"While my agent was working, I could be in meetings, talking to clients, doing strategy. The development happened in parallel, not sequentially."*

---

## 🎯 **Audience Call to Action** (1 minute)

### **The Repository Offer**
*"Everything I just showed you is codified in this repository:"*

**[Show GitHub repo URL]**

*"Clone it right now. Open it with Claude Code or Codex. Your AI will read the configuration and upgrade itself with these methodologies."*

### **The Community Invitation**
*"This is just the beginning. We're building a community of developers who've moved beyond AI tools to cognitive infrastructure. Join us."*

### **The Business Reality**
*"Companies are already paying $10K+ for this kind of cognitive automation. The methodologies work. The market exists. The question is: Will you be building the future, or watching others build it?"*

## 🔧 **Technical Demo Backup Plans**

### **If Internet Fails**
- Pre-recorded demo videos ready
- Local examples with synthetic data
- Screenshots of successful runs

### **If Tools Don't Connect**
- Mock data demonstrating the concepts
- Audience walkthrough of methodology docs
- Focus on architectural principles

### **If Time Runs Short**
- Core message: "Attention decoupling is the breakthrough"
- Repository as takeaway: "Everything is documented here"
- Community invitation: "Let's continue this conversation"

---

## 🎪 **Audience Engagement Techniques**

### **Interactive Elements**
- *"Who here has experienced agent blocking?"* (Show of hands)
- *"How many hours per week do you spend waiting for AI?"* (Crowd response)
- *"Who wants to clone this repo right now?"* (Create urgency)

### **Real-Time Validation**
- Show actual logs and output during demo
- Display real business metrics and outcomes
- Use authentic examples from actual client work

### **Social Proof Integration**
- *"LABI, an AI biotech lab, saw this demo and immediately wanted to become users"*
- *"Enterprise teams at IBM, AWS, and BCG X are implementing these patterns"*
- *"This methodology generated our first enterprise pipeline"*

---

## 🚀 **Post-Demo Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Repository Distribution**: Share GitHub link via QR code and Slack
2. **Community Building**: Invite to ongoing Claude Code cognitive infrastructure group
3. **Strategic Networking**: Target enterprise attendees for follow-up conversations
4. **Case Study Collection**: Document interest and early adoption stories

### **Follow-Up Strategy**
- **Week 1**: Help early adopters implement methodologies
- **Week 2**: Collect success stories and refinement feedback
- **Month 1**: Build community of cognitive infrastructure practitioners
- **Month 3**: Create advanced patterns and enterprise implementations

---

**🎯 Success Metric**: Audience leaves thinking "I need to fundamentally change how I work with AI" rather than "That was a cool demo."**

*This demo script proves cognitive infrastructure engineering as the paradigm shift, not just another productivity hack.*
