# RUBE Integration Patterns
## 500+ App Connectivity for Cognitive Automation

**üéØ Purpose**: Systematic patterns for leveraging RUBE MCP to transform scattered data sources into unified cognitive intelligence.

**‚ö° Key Insight**: True cognitive automation requires access to ALL user data sources - email, calendar, documents, social, project management, and more.

---

## üåê **RUBE MCP Foundation**

### **What RUBE Enables**
- **500+ App Integrations**: Gmail, Calendar, Slack, Linear, GitHub, Drive, Notion, etc.
- **Unified Data Access**: Single interface for all business intelligence sources
- **Cross-Platform Intelligence**: Correlate insights across disconnected tools
- **Systematic Automation**: Replace manual data gathering with intelligent workflows

### **Core Integration Philosophy**
```typescript
// Transform scattered tools into unified intelligence
const cognitiveAutomation = {
  before: "Manual data gathering across 10+ apps",
  after: "Unified intelligent workflows through RUBE",
  result: "Executive-ready insights without technical complexity"
}
```

---

## üîß **Setup and Configuration**

### **RUBE MCP Installation**
```bash
# Add RUBE MCP server for 500+ app connectivity
claude mcp add rube --transport sse https://mcp.composio.dev/v1/sse

# Verify connection
claude mcp list

# Test basic connectivity
claude rube search "email calendar integration"
```

### **Authentication Flow**
```bash
# Connect primary business tools
claude rube connect gmail calendar googledrive slack linear github

# Verify authentication status
claude rube status --show-connected-apps
```

---

## üéØ **Cognitive Automation Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Knowledge Base Maintenance** (Parth's $10K Problem)
```bash
# Automated knowledge synthesis from multiple sources
claude rube task "Update knowledge base with vendor procedures" \
  --sources "gmail,googledrive,slack" \
  --output "hierarchical_knowledge_base" \
  --format "executive_summary"

# Result: 30-second automation replacing 4-hour manual work
```

### **Pattern 2: Competitive Intelligence Automation**
```bash
# Systematic market analysis across platforms
claude rube task "Monitor competitor activity and generate insights" \
  --sources "twitter,linkedin,github,news" \
  --output "competitive_analysis_report" \
  --frequency "daily"
```

### **Pattern 3: Customer Intelligence Synthesis**
```bash
# Unified customer insights from all touchpoints
claude rube task "Synthesize customer feedback patterns" \
  --sources "slack,email,linear,github_issues" \
  --output "customer_intelligence_dashboard" \
  --insight_level "strategic"
```

### **Pattern 4: Business Intelligence Automation**
```bash
# Financial and operational metrics across tools
claude rube task "Generate business intelligence report" \
  --sources "googledrive,email,calendar,slack" \
  --output "executive_business_dashboard" \
  --metrics "revenue,pipeline,productivity"
```

## üß† **Advanced Cognitive Workflows**

### **Multi-Source Data Correlation**
```typescript
// Intelligent cross-platform insights
const correlationWorkflow = {
  step1: "Gather data from gmail, calendar, slack, linear",
  step2: "Identify patterns across communication and project tools",
  step3: "Generate insights about team productivity and business outcomes",
  step4: "Present executive-ready recommendations"
}
```

### **Proactive Monitoring Setup**
```bash
# Continuous intelligence gathering
claude rube monitor "vendor pricing changes" \
  --sources "email,googledrive,web" \
  --alert_threshold "10% price variance" \
  --notification "slack:alerts"

claude rube monitor "customer satisfaction trends" \
  --sources "slack,email,linear" \
  --insight_frequency "weekly" \
  --dashboard_update "real_time"
```

---

## üîÑ **Integration with Existing Workflows**

### **Email + Calendar Intelligence**
```bash
# Systematic communication analysis
claude rube analyze "meeting effectiveness patterns" \
  --email_context "last_30_days" \
  --calendar_data "meeting_outcomes" \
  --output "productivity_optimization_report"
```

### **Project Management Enhancement**
```bash
# Linear ticket intelligence with external context
claude rube enhance "linear ticket prioritization" \
  --external_context "email,slack,googledrive" \
  --business_intelligence "revenue_impact,customer_feedback" \
  --output "strategic_backlog_prioritization"
```

### **Content and Marketing Automation**
```bash
# Social media and content intelligence
claude rube generate "content strategy recommendations" \
  --social_sources "twitter,linkedin" \
  --business_context "googledrive,email" \
  --competitor_analysis "web_monitoring" \
  --output "content_calendar_with_insights"
```

---

## üé™ **Live Demo Scenarios**

### **Demo 1: Real-Time Knowledge Synthesis**
```bash
# Show live automation in front of audience
claude rube demo "vendor procedure updates" \
  --live_sources "demo_email,demo_drive" \
  --audience_visible "true" \
  --output_format "executive_presentation"

# Audience sees: 4-hour manual work completed in 30 seconds
```

### **Demo 2: Cross-Platform Intelligence**
```bash
# Show correlation across multiple tools
claude rube demo "business intelligence synthesis" \
  --sources "multiple_demo_accounts" \
  --correlation_analysis "revenue,communication,productivity" \
  --live_dashboard "true"

# Audience sees: Scattered data becomes strategic insights
```

### **Demo 3: Competitive Analysis Automation**
```bash
# Show systematic market intelligence
claude rube demo "competitor monitoring setup" \
  --sources "web,social,github" \
  --analysis_depth "strategic" \
  --automation_frequency "continuous"

# Audience sees: Manual research becomes automated intelligence
```

### **Custom Cognitive Workflows**
```yaml
# Define organization-specific automation
custom_workflows:
  knowledge_maintenance:
    sources: [email, googledrive, slack, linear]
    frequency: daily
    output: hierarchical_knowledge_base
    stakeholders: [executives, operations]

  competitive_intelligence:
    sources: [web, social, github, news]
    frequency: weekly
    output: strategic_market_analysis
    stakeholders: [strategy, product]

  customer_intelligence:
    sources: [slack, email, linear, github_issues]
    frequency: real_time
    output: customer_satisfaction_dashboard
    stakeholders: [product, support, sales]
```

### **Cross-Tool Automation Rules**
```typescript
// Intelligent workflow coordination
const automationRules = {
  email_to_calendar: "Auto-schedule meetings from email requests",
  slack_to_linear: "Convert urgent messages to tracked issues",
  drive_to_knowledge: "Synthesize documents into searchable knowledge base",
  github_to_reporting: "Technical progress updates to business dashboards"
}
