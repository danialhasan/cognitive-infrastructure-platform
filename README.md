## 🚀 **Cognitive Infrastructure Patterns**

### **Attention Decoupling**
Break the human attention → agent productivity coupling through systematic methodology:
- **Problem**: Agents block on human attention, reducing productivity
- **Solution**: Autonomous agent workflows with business requirement guardrails
- **Result**: Agents work while you focus on strategy

### **Business Alignment Automation**
Ensure agents build the right things, not just functional things:
- **Problem**: Agents build code that doesn't meet business requirements
- **Solution**: TDD methodology forces business requirement compliance first
- **Result**: Every line of code validated against actual business needs

### **Cognitive Task Architecture**
Transform AI from tools into persistent cognitive infrastructure:
- **Problem**: AI conversations start from zero context every time
- **Solution**: Systematic context engineering and agent specialization
- **Result**: Compound cognitive value that improves over time

## 📋 **Methodology Overview**

### **🔄 Claude Code + RUBE Integration**
1. **RUBE MCP Setup**: Connect 500+ apps seamlessly
2. **Cognitive Agent Definitions**: Pre-built specialists for different domains
3. **Context Engineering**: Systematic knowledge base automation
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Parallel deployment with specialized roles

### **🧪 Codex + TDD Autonomous Development**
1. **Sprint Planning**: Business requirements → systematic ticket generation
2. **Infrastructure Setup**: Test runner + dev server with log piping
3. **Autonomous TDD Cycles**: Red tests → Green implementation → Refactor → Verify
4. **Attention Decoupling**: Agents work independently using piped logs for feedback
